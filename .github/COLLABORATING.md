# Collaboration Guidelines

Please adhere to the following guidelines to give everyone the best experience possible:

## Etiquette

Please adhere to the [CODE OF CONDUCT](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when reviewing suggestions and participating in discussions on the project's Github account.

Always be polite and thank people, even if you don’t accept their suggestions.

You are welcome to suggest projects that you are personally involved with, or those of friends, family or colleagues, but you are not allowed to review or merge them yourself, nor should you request that others do so for you. They must be reviewed by a neutral collaborator in their own time.

If you provide feedback on a suggested project please be friendly and constructive.

## Reviewing

Please work through the following checklist when reviewing a project:

- Ensure suggestions adhere to [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Validate URLs work correctly and don't point to anything malicious.
- Two approvals per pull request is preferred, but not required.
- Simple pull requests fixing typos, formatting and broken links can be merged with a single approval.

## Enhancements

If you have an idea on how to improve the project, please open a ticket for discussion using the `Enhancement` label. Please don’t make any broad or sweeping changes without consulting other collaborators first and reaching a consensus.
